        Kevin Baker is the founder of DaVinci Dynamics, a revenue systems and automation firm
        focused on telecom growth, ecommerce conversion, and operational scale. With deep telecom
        sales and dealer network experience, Kevin designs systems built for production, not
        presentation. Across projects like WiFi-Kings.com, DaVinciDynamics.ai, and BossHookah.site,
        the focus remains consistent: increase conversion, remove manual friction, improve margin,
        build scalable infrastructure, and maintain clean documented systems. If a system cannot
        scale, it is redesigned. If it does not increase revenue, it is removed.
